Object Plans (CACHESTORE_OBJCP)
Object Plans include plans for stored procedures, functions, and triggers

SQL Plans (CACHESTORE_SQLCP)
SQL Plans include the plans for adhoc cached plans, autoparameterized plans, and prepared plans.

Bound Trees (CACHESTORE_OBJCP)
Bound Trees are the structures produced by SQL Serverï¿½s algebrizer for views, constraints, and defaults.

Extended Stored Procedures (CACHESTORE_OBJCP)
Extended Procs (Xprocs) are predefined system procedures, like sp_executeSql and sp_tracecreate, that are defined using a DLL, not using Transact-SQL statements. The cached structure contains only the function name and the DLL name in which the procedure is implemented.
