/*********************************************************************
You're tasked with quickly identifying if there's any quick indexing wins to speed up performance

Run the script Topic-9_Indexing-Untamed-Server_Setup.sql to simulate the workload

Strategize: 

* Outline what you will do to find out which indexes would make the most difference (if any): 

* Are you concerned about anything your strategy might miss?


Extra credit: use any scripts or tools you already have on-hand, or use built in tools to 
diagnose the top couple of index potentials, if you have time
